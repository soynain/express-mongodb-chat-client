# MongoDBChatClientVue

Welcome to my repo, here is my practice about how to make a chat client for a server
that uses graphql to handle subscriptions between clients.

Messages are broadcasted inmediately, as a normal websocket works

But I cannot get to work the online status, is difficult to create an aproach to keep online status when someone is reloading a page or something, so I plan on doing another project similar but with other technologies, here I practiced GraphQL above all, with subscriptions. So even if it's kinda incomplete, I've learned some good stuff from here
